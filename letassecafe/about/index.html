					<h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>Le Tasse Caf&eacute; opened in August 2010
              in historic Cornerstone district. <br> </br>
              Caf&eacute; owners Jonathan, Meryl, Pat &amp; Eva
              are long-time proud residents of the neighborhood.<br>
							So far, they happen to be faceless in order to stand-in <br>
							for any photographic list of incredible team members, <br>
							but it turns out that they don't mind one bit.
              </p>
